Word Cloud Generator

An interactive web application that creates customizable word clouds to help users visualize patterns and trends in text data. Developed as a senior capstone project at St. Norbert College (2023), this tool applies Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles to deliver a clean and user-friendly interface.

Problem Statement

Text-heavy datasets can be challenging to analyze, with important terms often hidden within large amounts of information. Traditional methods like lists or tables fail to highlight recurring keywords effectively.

Solution

This project addresses the problem by dynamically generating word clouds where word size corresponds to frequency, making it easier to identify key patterns and insights at a glance.

Features

Upload or paste text input to generate a word cloud

Words scale dynamically based on frequency

Customization options (colors, font sizes, layouts)

Clean and accessible design using HCI principles

Technologies Used

HTML â€“ structure and layout

CSS â€“ styling and design

JavaScript â€“ interactivity and word cloud generation
